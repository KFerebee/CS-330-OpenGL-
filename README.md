OpenGL 3D Scene 

Modeling geometric forms to represent its components was required when building my unique PC in OpenGL. A rectangular prism was utilized to form the PC casing, while smaller boxes, planes, and cylinders were employed to represent things such as the GPU, CPU open air cooler, motherboard, and SF750 battery. Similarly, the desk, another rectangular prism, was proportionally proportioned to mimic my workspace arrangement and a simple white plane to represent a backdrop. The objects were then rotated and modified to align with the reference image. Originally, before texturing, each shape was represented by a different hue. This assisted in separating each object in the scene. 

Textures played a crucial role in enhancing the realism of the scene. A brushed metal texture was applied to the PC case, giving it a sleek, modern appearance. This texture was sourced from an image file and mapped onto the PC case surfaces using texture coordinates. In contrast, a wooden texture was used for the desk surface, providing a warm contrast to the metallic PC case. This combination of textures added visual appeal and contributed to creating a lifelike office or home environment.
Effective lighting was essential for achieving depth and realism. I implemented both ambient and directional lighting in the scene. Ambient light ensured overall visibility of objects, while directional light simulated light from a specific direction, casting shadows and highlighting surfaces realistically.

The primary goal of this 3D scene was to create a visually realistic and relatable environment. By choosing a custom PC and desk, I aimed to replicate my own personal workspace, familiar to many users. The selection of textures—brushed metal for the PC and wood for the desk—enhanced the scene's authenticity and engagement. Incorporating ambient and directional lighting further enhanced the depth and realism of the environment, ensuring a compelling visual experience.
To achieve functionality, I utilized various OpenGL functions and techniques. Geometric shapes were modeled using basic primitives such as cubes and cylinders, while texture mapping involved loading image files and applying them using texture coordinates. Lighting was implemented through OpenGL's built-in lighting model, enabling straightforward setup of ambient and directional lights. These techniques were integral to creating a realistic 3D scene.

User interaction was facilitated through an interactive navigation system. Users could manipulate the camera to explore the scene by using input devices like the keyboard and mouse. Keyboard inputs controlled basic movements—forward, backward, left, and right—while mouse movements allowed for more precise control, such as rotating the camera and zooming in and out. This setup provided a natural and intuitive way for users to interact with the 3D environment.
The virtual camera was initialized with default settings that offered a comprehensive view of the scene. Updates to the camera's position and orientation were driven by user input received from keyboard and mouse interactions. The gluLookAt function was employed to ensure accurate positioning and orientation of the camera, reflecting changes made through user input effectively.

Custom functions were categorized to serve specific purposes: drawing functions for rendering geometric shapes like cubes, texture management functions for loading and applying textures, lighting setup functions for configuring the lighting environment, and camera control functions for managing the camera's movements and orientation. These functions streamlined development, ensuring modular and organized code that supported the creation of a realistic and interactive 3D scene.
In conclusion, the development choices for this 3D scene were guided by a commitment to achieving visual realism and engagement. Through geometric modeling, texture mapping, and effective lighting, I aimed to create an immersive environment. User-friendly navigation controls and modular code further contributed to delivering a cohesive and interactive 3D experience.

Developing programs such as this, involves meticulous planning, coding, testing, and iteration. Throughout the project, I employed new strategies like texture mapping and lighting in OpenGL, which significantly contributed to the visual realism of the 3D scene. Iteration played a crucial role, allowing continuous refinement based on testing feedback and evolving requirements. This approach ensured that the final product was robust and met the specified requirements. The integration of modular design, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation evolved my development practices, leading to a more polished and maintainable codebase.

Computer science provides essential skills for solving complex problems and creating impactful software. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in computational graphics and visualizations, which are applicable to both educational and professional pathways. In education, these skills enhance my ability to create engaging visual content for research and academic projects. Professionally, they prepare me for roles in software development, particularly in fields like virtual reality, game development, and multimedia applications, enabling me to develop innovative and interactive solutions.
